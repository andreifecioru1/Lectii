A special program called a compiler converts your source code into a different format that is executable by the computer's CPU. When you used the green Run button in the previous unit, the code you wrote was first compiled, then executed.

Why do we need to compile our code? Even though most programming languages seem cryptic at first, they can be more easily understood by humans than the computer's preferred language, which is expressed by turning thousands or millions of tiny switches either on or off. Compilers bridge these two worlds by translating your human-readable instructions into a computer-understandable set of instructions.
