A special program called a compiler converts your source code into a different format that is executable by the computer's CPU. When you used the green Run button in the previous unit, the code you wrote was first compiled, 

The syntax of a programming language includes the keywords, the operators (those special keyboard characters like the semicolon or parenthesis), and other grammar rules that the compiler enforces. The lines of code you typed followed about a dozen different syntax rules and used at least four different operators. There's much to learn, but fortunately each concept is simple. Don't give up! You can learn it!
